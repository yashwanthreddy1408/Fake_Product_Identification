# Fake Product Identification System

## Project Overview
This project addresses the growing issue of counterfeit products by developing a QR code-based system to ensure product authenticity. The web application enables consumers to verify and track the authenticity of their purchases from production to delivery, fostering trust and protecting brand integrity.

## Features
- **QR Code Integration**: Each product is assigned a unique QR code for easy identification and tracking.
- **Product Authentication**: Users can scan QR codes to verify the authenticity of products in real-time.
- **E-Commerce Features**: Includes cart, checkout, and order tracking for a seamless authentication experience.
- **Real-Time Product Verification**: The application connects to a secure MySQL database for verifying product authenticity as soon as a QR code is scanned.
- **Product Traceability**: Trace the product journey from production to delivery by scanning the QR code.

## How to Use
1. Open the web application in your browser.
2. Scan the QR code on the product using your mobile device or web camera.
3. The application will display the productâ€™s authenticity status and provide traceability information.
4. You can make a purchase, track your order, and authenticate your product with each scan.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend**: MySQL for secure product verification and traceability  
- **QR Code Generation**: PHP for generating unique QR codes for each product  
- **Real-Time Product Verification**: PHP and MySQL for immediate authentication  
- **E-Commerce Features**: Cart, checkout, and order tracking for user convenience
